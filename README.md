# ITCS-6166-8166-CCN
This is a repository for the final project of **Group 12** for the course **ITCS 6166/8166 (Computer Communication and Networks)** under the guidance of **Dr. Pu Wang**. It has detailed instructions on how to run the project using Google Colab.
We recreated the results of the project **HumanNeRF: Free-viewpoint Rendering of Moving People from Monocular Video (Weng et al., 2022)**
